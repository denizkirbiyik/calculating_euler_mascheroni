# calculating_euler_mascheroni
Various algorithms to calculate euler's constant (also called the euler-mascheroni constant).
## Fastest Converging Algorithm
For lower values of infinity, euler_mascheroni_vacca_avg.py is the fastest. For higher values of infinity, euler_mascheroni_vacca.py is faster. Regardless, you will get simmilar results with either one.
